========================

How to migrate jquery plugin(date-picker) to angularjs, and the basic workflow.

Here is a few highlights:

1.  Using grunt for jshint and run the unit test
2.  Using karma to run the unit test
3.  Using require-js for load all resources asyncly.
4.  Modulized code structure
5.  Migrate datepicker to angular-js, and have unit tests

There is also a `index.jq.html` inside, just in case if someone want to `compare` jquery way and angular way.
